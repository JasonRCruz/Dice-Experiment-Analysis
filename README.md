# Dice-Experiment-Analysis
 This Python code simulates rolling 6 dice and calculates the sum of their values (Part A) and the difference between the highest and lowest roll (Part B). It then computes the Probability Mass Function (PMF) for each part, showing the probability of each outcome.

This Project relies on two dependencies: the random and counter libraries. It is encapsulated in one Python file that will work if run on any IDE compatible with Python 3.10.
